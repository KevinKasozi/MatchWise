# MatchWise

**MatchWise** is an open-source football data platform for ingesting, normalizing, and predicting football match outcomes. It is designed for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to work with comprehensive, structured football data from global leagues and competitions.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Automated Data Ingestion:** Robust scripts to parse, normalize, and ingest raw football data (fixtures, clubs, squads, results) from open data sources.
- **Team Name Normalization:** Advanced mapping to unify team/club names across inconsistent datasets.
- **Modern Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic for scalable APIs and database management.
- **Frontend:** Built with Vite and React for a fast, modern user experience.
- **Extensible Parsers:** Modular ingestion pipeline supports new data formats and competitions.
- **Validation & Auditing:** Scripts to check data completeness, consistency, and assignment.
- **Open Source:** MIT licensed, easy to contribute and extend.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Build Team Name Mapper**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.team_mapper_builder --use-db
   ```
2. **Run Full Ingestion**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.enhanced_ingestion --force --parallel --threads 4
   # or
   ./scripts/run_full_ingestion.sh
   ```
3. **Validate Data**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.verify_team_assignments
   ```

- All raw data is in `backend/data/raw/` (organized by country/league/season).
- Ingestion scripts handle normalization, upserts, and logging.
- See `scripts/README_INGESTION.md` for advanced usage.

---

## üß© Key Components
- **`app/models/models.py`**: SQLAlchemy models for clubs, teams, fixtures, results, etc.
- **`scripts/enhanced_ingestion.py`**: Main ingestion script (batch, parallel, robust).
- **`scripts/team_mapper_builder.py`**: Builds the team name normalization map.
- **`frontend/`**: Vite + React app for data exploration and prediction UI.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Validation & Auditing
- **`scripts/verify_team_assignments.py`**: Checks for misassigned teams/fixtures.
- **Audit logs**: All ingestion actions are logged for traceability.
